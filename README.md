# üìö Awesome Ontologies
A curated list of ontologies for semantic interoperability, AI systems, knowledge graphs, the semantic web, and digital twins.

**All contributions must include updates to the main README.md file.** Your ontology should be added to the appropriate section (Upper-Level, Mid-Level, Domain Ontologies, etc.) following the existing format:

```markdown
- [Ontology Name](link-to-source) - Brief description of the ontology.
```

Contributions that don't include README updates will not be accepted.
